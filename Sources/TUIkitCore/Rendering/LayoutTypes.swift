/// The size a view needs and whether it can flex.
///
/// Views return this from `sizeThatFits` to communicate their space requirements.
///
/// ## Flexibility contract
///
/// An axis is **flexible** iff, when offered more space than the view's ideal
/// along that axis, the view's *rendered output fills the offered extent*. The
/// reported `width`/`height` is then a **minimum**. Examples: `Spacer`,
/// `.frame(maxWidth: .infinity)`, `List` (fills its column).
///
/// An axis is **fixed** iff the view renders at a specific size and does *not*
/// grow past its ideal when offered more. The reported `width`/`height` is then
/// **exactly** what it renders.
///
/// - Important: A *wrapping* `Text` is **fixed**, not flexible. It reflows to
///   use width up to its ideal (single-line) width — so the retired render-twice
///   "+8" probe saw the width grow when the proposal was *below* that ideal and
///   would wrongly call it flexible — but it never grows *past* the ideal, so it
///   does not fill arbitrary space. Flexibility means "fills unbounded available
///   space", not "reflows within it".
///
/// - Important: A few views — `ViewThatFits` above all — are **available-width
///   dependent**: their reported (and rendered) size is a function of the
///   *available* extent, not the proposal alone, because they switch which
///   candidate they present as the space changes. They still honour the contract
///   (measured == rendered *at a given width*), but their size is not constant
///   across widths the way an ordinary fixed view's is. A parent must therefore
///   measure and render such a child at the **same** available width; measuring
///   at one width and rendering at another can land on different candidates and
///   mis-size it.
///
/// This yields the invariant the measure/render equivalence harness asserts, for
/// available extent `E`:
/// - flexible axis ⟹ `rendered == E` (it fills) and `reported ≤ E` (a minimum);
/// - fixed axis ⟹ `rendered == reported` (exact).
///
/// For a `Layoutable` view, `sizeThatFits` is the **canonical** (and now sole)
/// source of this flag. `measureChild`'s fallback for the remaining
/// `Renderable`-only views reports **fixed** (a single render); a view that
/// fills its width must conform to `Layoutable` to advertise it. (The fallback
/// once guessed flexibility from a "+8" render probe, but that approximation
/// over-reported wrapping content and was retired — it was never the contract.)

//  🖥️ TUIKit — Terminal UI Kit for Swift
//  String+CursorCompensation.swift
//
//  Terminal-specific cursor-advance workarounds for the output path: some
//  terminals move the cursor by a different amount than the cells a glyph
//  paints, so `FrameDiffWriter` rewrites each built line through the walk
//  matching the detected host. The per-host advance MODELS live beside
//  `terminalWidth` (`Character.terminalAppCursorAdvance` /
//  `Character.iTerm2CursorAdvance`); this file holds the line rewriters.
//  Every model value is DSR-measured — see
//  Documentation/Terminal-compatibility.md, and update it when anything
//  here changes.

// MARK: - Focus Manager

/// Manages focus state across the application.
///
/// The focus manager organizes interactive elements into **focus sections**.
/// Each section is a named, focusable area (e.g. a sidebar, a content panel,
/// a modal) that contains its own list of focusable elements.
///
/// - **Tab / Shift+Tab** cycles between sections.
/// - **Up/Down arrows** navigate within the active section's focusable elements.
/// - **Enter/Space** activates the focused element.
///
/// Elements registered without an explicit section go into a default section.
/// When only one section exists, Tab cycles elements within it (legacy behavior).
///
/// `FocusManager` is injected via the Environment system.
/// Each app instance gets its own `FocusManager`, ensuring test isolation.
///
/// # Usage
///
/// ```swift
/// // Access via Environment in views
/// let focusManager = context.environment.focusManager
///
/// // Register a section (done by .focusSection() modifier)
/// focusManager.registerSection(id: "playlist")
///
/// // Register a focusable element in a section
/// focusManager.register(button, inSection: "playlist")
///
/// // Move focus
/// focusManager.focusNextInSection()     // within active section
/// focusManager.focusPreviousInSection() // within active section
/// focusManager.activateNextSection()    // switch to next section
///
/// // Check focus
/// if focusManager.isFocused(button) {
///     // render focused style
/// }
/// ```

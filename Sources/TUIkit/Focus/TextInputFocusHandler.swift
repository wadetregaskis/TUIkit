/// A focus handler that consumes ordinary typed characters as CONTENT.
///
/// Adopting this is what puts a handler behind the input dispatcher's layer-0
/// gate: while one is focused, typed keys reach it BEFORE status-bar items and
/// `onKeyPress` handlers, so typing "q" into a field cannot quit the app. The
/// gate used to test `is TextFieldHandler` literally — which is how
/// `TextEditor`, a separate class, shipped with its keystrokes stealable by
/// any lettered status item on the page. A new text-consuming handler adopts
/// this marker; it does not extend a type test.

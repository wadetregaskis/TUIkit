/// A single notification in the service queue.
///
/// Each entry carries the message, timing, and a unique identifier
/// for lifecycle tracking. Entries are created by ``NotificationService/post(_:duration:)``
/// and consumed by the `NotificationHostModifier` during rendering.

// MARK: - Notification Service

/// Central service for posting and managing notifications.
///
/// `NotificationService` lives in the environment and accepts fire-and-forget
/// notification posts from anywhere in the view hierarchy. The
/// `NotificationHostModifier` reads the active entries and renders them
/// as a stacked overlay.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// Post notifications from anywhere using the shared instance:
///
/// ```swift
/// NotificationService.current.post("Saved!")
/// NotificationService.current.post("Connection lost", duration: 5.0)
/// ```
///
/// Attach the host once at the root of your view tree:
///
/// ```swift
/// ContentView()
///     .notificationHost()
/// ```
///
/// ## Lifecycle
///
/// Each notification goes through three phases:
/// 1. **Fade-in** (0.2s) — opacity ramps from 0 to 1
/// 2. **Visible** — stays at full opacity for `duration` seconds
/// 3. **Fade-out** (0.3s) — opacity ramps from 1 to 0, then entry is removed
///
/// The service automatically removes expired entries and triggers re-renders
/// for animation frames.
public final class NotificationService: @unchecked Sendable {
    /// The shared instance used by the running application.
    ///
    /// This is a static accessor rather than environment-only because TUIKit
    /// does not have an `@Environment` property wrapper. Button callbacks,
    /// `onSelect` handlers, and other user-facing closures run outside the
    /// render context and therefore cannot read `EnvironmentValues`. A static
    /// reference is the only way to reach the service from those call sites.
    ///
    /// The same pattern is used by `AppState.shared` for the same reason.
    /// For tests, create a fresh instance instead of using `current`.
    ///
    /// ```swift
    /// NotificationService.current.post("Done!")
    /// ```

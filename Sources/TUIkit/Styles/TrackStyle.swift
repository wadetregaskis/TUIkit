// MARK: - Track Style

/// The visual style of a track-based control like ProgressView or Slider.
///
/// TUIKit provides five built-in styles using different Unicode characters:
///
/// ```
/// bar:       ▌▌▌▌▌▌▌▌▌▌▌▌▌▌▌▌────────────────
/// block:     ████████████████                 (empty run is a solid bg)
/// blockFine: ████████████████▍                (sub-cell precision; solid bg)
/// dot:       ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬●────────────────
/// knob:      ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━●────────────────   (Slider default)
/// shade:     ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░
/// ```
///
/// The "fill" styles (``bar``, ``block``, ``blockFine``, ``shade``,
/// ``braille``, ``shadeRamp(gradient:)``) are presets of ``TrackConfiguration``
/// and share one renderer; ``custom(_:)`` lets you supply your own recipe.
public enum TrackStyle: Sendable, Equatable {
    /// Vertical bar characters with a horizontal line track.
    ///
    /// Uses `▌` for filled and `─` for empty.
    case bar

    /// Full block characters (default).
    ///
    /// Uses `█` for filled cells and a solid background for the empty run —
    /// NOT a `░` shade glyph, which reads taller than `█` on terminals whose
    /// font draws the shades as a sparse crosshatch (iTerm2). The result is a
    /// uniform-height two-tone bar. See ``TrackConfiguration/block``.
    case block

    /// Full block characters with sub-character fractional precision.
    ///
    /// Uses `█` for filled cells and fractional blocks (`▉▊▋▌▍▎▏`) for the
    /// partial cell at the boundary — 8× finer visual resolution than
    /// ``block``. The unfilled region is a solid background (not `░` glyphs),
    /// so the boundary cell's remainder matches the empty run and any
    /// inter-cell gaps in the fill show the bar's colour, keeping it one solid
    /// unit. See ``TrackConfiguration/blockFine``.
    case blockFine

    /// Rectangle track with a dot indicator at the progress position.
    ///
    /// Uses `▬` for filled, `●` as the progress head, and `─` for empty.
    /// The dot head renders in the accent color.
    case dot

    /// A thin rail with a round knob at the value — the ``Slider`` default.
    ///
    /// Uses `━` (heavy line) for the filled rail, `●` as the knob, and `─`
    /// (light line) for the empty rail. The knob renders in the accent color.
    /// The rail-and-knob reads unmistakably as a draggable control, distinct
    /// from ``ProgressView``'s solid block bar and ``Gauge``'s shaded meter.
    case knob

    /// A plain line with a marker at the value and NO fill — `─────●─────`.
    ///
    /// Uses `─` on BOTH sides of the position and `●` as the accent marker.
    /// Unlike ``dot``/``knob`` (which fill up to the marker), this only marks
    /// the position — used by the non-capacity `Gauge` accessory style, which
    /// shows *where* the value sits rather than a filled range.
    case marker

    /// Shade characters for a softer, textured look.
    ///
    /// Uses `▓` (dark shade) for filled and `░` (light shade) for empty. This
    /// differs from ``block`` only in the fill glyph (`▓` vs `█`), so on most
    /// terminal fonts the two read alike; ``shadeRamp(gradient:)`` is the
    /// style that delivers a visibly graded "shaded" look.
    case shade

    /// Braille dot fill, 8 steps per cell using `⣀⣄⣤⣦⣶⣷⣿`.
    ///
    /// Each cell ramps up from "nothing" to "full" through seven
    /// intermediate dot patterns, so the rightmost cell of the filled
    /// region shows the fractional sub-cell progress at the cost of
    /// just one glyph. Empty cells use `⠀` (braille blank).

    /// 4-step shade-ramp fill `░▒▓█` with an optional colour gradient.
    ///
    /// Each cell picks from `░ ▒ ▓ █` based on its sub-cell fraction —
    /// so the rightmost filled cell carries the boundary's fractional
    /// information visually rather than via colour. When
    /// `gradient` is non-nil, the filled portion interpolates between
    /// the supplied stops, smoothly fading across the track regardless
    /// of how many cells are lit. Empty cells use `·`.

    /// `Swiiiiiiift` at a wide track or `Swift` at the narrow end.
    ///
    /// `leading` is drawn once at the left of the filled region;
    /// `trailing` once at the right of the filled region; `middle` is
    /// repeated across the gap between them. Empty cells are filled with
    /// a space, padded out to the track's width.
    ///
    /// `coloring` selects how the lit region is coloured: the control's
    /// own filled colour (``SegmentColoring/automatic``, the default), one
    /// solid colour, a colour per segment, or a per-cell gradient across
    /// the lit span. With `.automatic`/`.solid`/`.perSegment` the segment
    /// strings may carry their own embedded ANSI styling; `.gradient`
    /// re-colours every cell, so it expects plain segment text.
    ///
    /// (Five associated values is the honest shape here — three segment
    /// strings, the unfilled fill, and the colouring are orthogonal, and
    /// bundling them into a struct would just add a second spelling of the

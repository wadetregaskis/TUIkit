# Modals, Sheets, and Alerts

Present overlays — alerts, modal dialogs, and transient notifications — above
the current screen.

## Overview

TUIkit presents alerts and modals as a **centred overlay that dims the whole
screen and captures keyboard input**, no matter where in the view tree the
modifier is attached. The overlay is hosted at the root, so you can hang it off
any subtree rather than a special full-screen container. <kbd>Esc</kbd>
dismisses the presentation.

## Alerts

Use `alert(_:isPresented:actions:message:)` for a titled alert with an
actions area and an optional message. Bind it to a `Bool` state:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var confirming = false

    var body: some View {
        Button("Delete") { confirming = true }
            .alert("Delete this item?", isPresented: $confirming) {
                Button("Delete") { deleteItem() }
                Button("Cancel") {}
            } message: {
                Text("This action cannot be undone.")
            }
    }
}
```

An overload without the `message:` closure presents an actions-only alert. Both
accept optional `borderStyle`, `borderColor`, and `titleColor` arguments for
terminal-specific styling.

## Modals and Sheets

`modal(isPresented:onDismiss:content:)` presents arbitrary content with the
same centred, screen-dimming treatment.
`sheet(isPresented:onDismiss:content:)` is a SwiftUI-compatible alias that
forwards to `modal`:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var showingDetails = false

    var body: some View {
        Button("Show details") { showingDetails = true }
            .sheet(isPresented: $showingDetails) {
                DetailView()
            }
    }
}
```

The optional `onDismiss:` closure runs on the presented → dismissed
transition, whatever cleared the binding — a Close button, a key press, or a
programmatic change.

As in SwiftUI, there is also an item-driven overload,
`sheet(item:onDismiss:content:)`: a non-`nil` `Identifiable` value presents
the sheet, built from the unwrapped item, and clearing the binding dismisses
it:

```swift
@State private var editing: Row?

List(rows, selection: $selection) { ... }
    .sheet(item: $editing) { row in
        EditView(row)
    }
```

There is also an always-on `modal { … }` overload (bound to a constant `true`)
for content that should always be presented while its host is on screen.

> Note: TUIkit does not currently provide `.popover` or `.confirmationDialog`.

## Notifications

Notifications are toast-style messages that appear briefly and then fade,
**without** dimming or blocking the background. Add a host where they should be
drawn with `notificationHost(width:)`, then post from anywhere — they are
delivered out of band, not declared in the view tree:

```swift
// Install the host once, near the root:
ContentView()
    .notificationHost()

// Post from anywhere, including non-view code:
NotificationService.current.post("Saved!", duration: 2.0)
```

Because the host is independent of the view that posts, a notification survives
navigation between screens.

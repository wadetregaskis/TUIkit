/// A view that generates views from a collection of data.
///
/// `ForEach` iterates over a collection and creates a view for each
/// element. The collection elements must be `Identifiable` or an
/// explicit ID key path must be provided.
///
/// ## Rendering
///
/// `ForEach` has **no standalone rendering capability**. It declares
/// `body: Never` but does *not* conform to `Renderable`. On its own,
/// it would produce an empty ``FrameBuffer``.
///
/// In practice, `ForEach` is always used inside a `@ViewBuilder` block
/// (e.g. within `VStack` or `HStack`). The builder's `buildArray`
/// method flattens it into a ``ViewArray``, which *is* `Renderable`.
/// This is the same pattern SwiftUI uses.
///
/// # Example with Identifiable
///
/// ```swift
/// struct Item: Identifiable {
///     let id: String
///     let name: String
/// }
///
/// let items = [Item(id: "1", name: "One"), Item(id: "2", name: "Two")]
///
/// VStack {
///     ForEach(items) { item in
///         Text(item.name)
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # Example with explicit ID key path
///
/// ```swift
/// let names = ["Anna", "Bob", "Clara"]
///
/// VStack {
///     ForEach(names, id: \.self) { name in
///         Text(name)
///     }
/// }
/// ```

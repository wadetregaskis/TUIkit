// MARK: - App Header State

/// Manages the app header state for the running application.
///
/// `AppHeaderState` stores the rendered content buffer that views
/// provide via the `.appHeader { ... }` modifier. The `RenderLoop`
/// reads this buffer each frame and renders it at the top of the terminal.
///
/// When no content is set, the header is hidden and no vertical space
/// is reserved.
///
/// # Usage
///
/// Views set the header content via the `.appHeader` modifier:
///
/// ```swift
/// VStack {
///     Text("Main content")
/// }
/// .appHeader {
///     HStack {
///         Text("My App").bold()
///         Spacer()
///         Text("v1.0")
///     }
/// }
/// ```
final class AppHeaderState: @unchecked Sendable {
    /// The rendered content buffer for the current frame.
    ///
    /// Set by ``AppHeaderModifier`` during rendering. Reset to `nil`
    /// at the start of each render pass by `RenderLoop`.
    var contentBuffer: FrameBuffer?

    /// The height from the previous render pass, used as an estimate
    /// for layout calculations before the current pass populates the buffer.
    ///
    /// Defaults to 2 (typical header: 1 content line + 1 divider line) to avoid
    /// content shifting on the first frame when an app header is present.
    /// Apps without a header will have this reset to 0 after the first frame.
    private var previousHeight: Int = 2

    /// Whether the header has content to display.

    }

    ///
    /// Returns the content height plus one line for the divider.
    /// Returns 0 when no content is set (header hidden).

        return (contentBuffer?.height ?? 0) + 1

    /// ``AppHeaderModifier`` populates the new buffer.

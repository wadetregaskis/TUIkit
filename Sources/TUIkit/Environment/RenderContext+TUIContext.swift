    ///   `TUIContext` (the focus manager, palette manager,
    ///   appearance manager, notification service, localization
    ///   service) are NOT set up by this initializer — callers

    ///   beforehand. The full production setup lives in
    ///   ``RenderLoop/makeRenderContext``. Tests using this init
    ///   that exercise click handling will want to set
    ///   `environment.focusManager` themselves.

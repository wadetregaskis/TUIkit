// MARK: - State Storage

/// Persistent store for `@State` values, indexed by `ViewIdentity`.
///
/// `StateStorage` is the backbone of TUIKit's state persistence across render
/// passes. It maps each `@State` property to a stable key derived from the
/// view's structural position in the tree (`ViewIdentity`) and the property's
/// declaration order within that view.
///
/// ## Lifecycle
///
/// - **Created** by `TUIContext` (one per application).
/// - **Populated** during rendering: when `renderToBuffer` hydrates a view's
///   `@State` properties, it looks up or creates `Storage` objects here.
/// - **Pruned** at the end of each render pass: identities not seen during
///   the current frame are removed (coordinated with `LifecycleManager`).
///
/// ## Thread Safety
///
/// `StateStorage` is accessed only from the main thread (TUIKit's single-threaded
/// event loop). No locking is required.

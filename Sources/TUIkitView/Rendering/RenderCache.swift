// MARK: - Render Cache

/// Caches rendered ``FrameBuffer`` results for views that opt into subtree memoization.
///
/// `RenderCache` is Phase 5 of TUIKit's render pipeline optimization. It stores
/// the output of ``EquatableView`` instances keyed by their `ViewIdentity`,
/// allowing unchanged subtrees to skip rendering entirely.
///
/// ## How It Works
///
/// When an ``EquatableView<V>`` renders, it:
/// 1. Looks up a cached entry by the current `ViewIdentity`
/// 2. Compares the new view value with the stored snapshot (`Equatable.==`)
/// 3. Checks that the available size hasn't changed
/// 4. On hit: returns the cached ``FrameBuffer`` — **the entire subtree is skipped**
/// 5. On miss: renders normally and stores the result
///
/// ## Invalidation
///
/// The cache is **fully cleared** whenever any `@State` value changes
/// (via `StateBox.value`'s `didSet`). This is conservative but correct:
/// state changes can propagate to any subtree through bindings or environment.
///
/// Between state changes (e.g. animation frames, pulse ticks), the cache
/// provides full memoization of unchanged subtrees.
///
/// ## Garbage Collection
///
/// Cache entries for `ViewIdentity` paths not seen during the current
/// render pass are removed in ``removeInactive()``, matching
/// `StateStorage`'s existing GC pattern.
///
/// ## Debug Logging
///
/// Set the environment variable `TUIKIT_DEBUG_RENDER=1` to enable per-frame
/// cache statistics logging to stderr. This logs hit/miss counts, cache size,
/// and individual identity lookups to help diagnose memoization effectiveness.
///
/// ## Thread Safety
///
/// `RenderCache` is accessed only from the main thread (TUIKit's single-threaded
/// event loop). No locking is required.

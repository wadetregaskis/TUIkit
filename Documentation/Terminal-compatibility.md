# Terminal compatibility survey

The canonical record of how each terminal emulator behaves on every axis
TUIkit cares about — input encodings (keys, mouse, trackpad) and output
behaviour (cursor advance vs painted width, emoji handling, glyph cell
coverage, colour depth) — plus the environment variables each one defines
and the exact versions the observations were made against.

**Maintenance contract:** whenever anything new is observed or learned
about any terminal's behaviour — a new quirk, a version that changes one,
a new terminal evaluated — record it here, with the version and the method
of observation. Consult this document before making or reviewing any
change that relies on terminal-specific behaviour (`TerminalHost`,
`Character.terminalAppCursorAdvance` / `.iTerm2CursorAdvance` /
`.ghosttyCursorAdvance` / `.warpCursorAdvance`, the `FrameDiffWriter`
compensation paths, `CheckboxStyle.automatic`, …).

**Terminals covered:** Apple Terminal.app, iTerm2, Ghostty, Warp
(measured); tmux (documented, unverified). Jump to the
[measured advance table](#measured-advance-table-divergences-and-key-rows)
for the one-screen comparison.

## Methodology

Three reproducible probes live in `Tools/TerminalProbes/`; run them INSIDE
the terminal under test:

- `advance_probe.py` — measures the **cursor advance** of a battery of
  grapheme clusters with DSR (`ESC[6n`) position queries, and dumps the
  terminal-relevant environment. Writes JSON to `$PROBE_OUT`. Advance is
  the ground truth for layout: a glyph whose advance differs from the
  width TUIkit's tables claim shifts everything after it on the row.
  **Set `PROBE_ALT=1` and use those numbers**: TUIkit apps run on the
  ALTERNATE screen buffer, and advance can differ between buffers —
  iTerm2 advances VS-16 clusters by 2 on its primary screen but by 1 on
  the alternate screen. A first pass probed the primary screen only,
  concluded iTerm2 had no VS-16 quirk, and shipped a wrong model. iTerm2
  is also sensitive to write boundaries on the primary screen: a VS-16
  selector flushed ~100 ms after its base retro-colours the glyph without
  advancing the cursor.
- `visual_card.py` — prints a static `|<cluster>|X` alignment card with a
  column ruler; screenshot + zoom shows **painted width** (which DSR
  cannot see) and glyph appearance: merged vs split clusters, seams,
  swatches, cell coverage.
- `mouse_probe.py` — enables SGR mouse reporting (1000/1002/1006) in raw
  mode and appends every input byte sequence to `$PROBE_OUT`, for
  capturing exactly what a terminal sends per gesture.

"Advance" below = cells the cursor moves; "paints" = cells with ink.
TUIkit's shared layout width (`Character.terminalWidth`) claims 2 for all
the emoji-class clusters below unless noted.

## Apple Terminal.app

**Tested:** `TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION` 455.1, macOS 15.7 (Sequoia), 2026-07-13.

### Environment

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `TERM` | `xterm-256color` |
| `TERM_PROGRAM` | `Apple_Terminal` |
| `TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION` | `455.1` |
| `TERM_SESSION_ID` | per-window UUID |
| `COLORTERM` | **not set** (no truecolor advertisement) |

### Output behaviour

- **Colour:** no truecolor — 256-colour palette is the ceiling
  (`ColorDepth` quantises; palettes must satisfy the WCAG contrast floor
  after quantisation).
- **VS-16 pictographic emoji** (❤️ ✏️ ☎️ 🖥️ 🛡️ …): paints 2,
  **advances 1** ("Bug A" — see `Emoji rendering bugs in macOS Sequoia's
  Terminal.app.md` for the full investigation). Compensated with CUF(1) by
  `withTerminalAppCursorCompensation()`. Exception: the East-Asian-Wide
  BMP bases 〰️ 〽️ ㊗️ ㊙️ advance their full 2.
- **Fitzpatrick skin tones:** the cluster renders as ONE merged,
  skin-toned glyph (paints 2) but **advances 4** (emoji-presentation
  bases: 👍🏽 ✊🏻) or **3** (text-presentation bases: ☝🏽; also ☝️🏽
  with VS-16) — "Bug B". Mid-line the modifier scalar is stripped
  (generic-yellow fallback) because the over-advance provokes a row-wide
  left shift no escape sequence recovers from; at end-of-line it is kept.
- **Flag pairs** (🇺🇸): paints 2, **advances 2** — no compensation.
  (An earlier TUIkit model said advance 1; measured 2 on 455.1.)
- **Lone regional indicator** (🇦): paints 2, **advances 1** → CUF(1).
- **Keycaps** (1️⃣ #️⃣, with or without VS-16): advance 2 ✓.
- **ZWJ sequences:** badly over-advance — 👩‍🚀 advances **5**,
  ❤️‍🔥 **4**, 👩🏽‍🚀 **7**. UNHANDLED (no compensation model); TUIkit
  chrome never emits ZWJ, but user content containing ZWJ sequences will
  shear rows here. Known limitation.
- **SF Symbols (Plane-16 PUA, U+100000+):** paints 2, **advances 1** →
  CUF(1). BMP PUA (e.g. U+E0B0 powerline): advances 1, width 1 ✓.
- **Emoji-repertoire chrome with VS-15** (⬛︎ ⬜︎ + U+FE0E): renders as a
  single seamless 2-cell monochrome, SGR-tintable glyph — *preferred*
  here because adjacent FULL BLOCK `█` cells show visible seams
  (incomplete cell coverage) in this terminal. This is why
  `CheckboxStyle.automatic` = `.emoji` on this host.
- **Block Elements:** `██` can show a hairline seam between cells;
  half-block pairs like `▐▌` render contiguously (they form the
  TextField caps and the switch knob). Shades ░▒▓ render as fine stipple.
  The image pipeline's half-block mode uses ▀ (upper) rather than ▄
  specifically to avoid a banding artifact observed here.
- **Right-edge phantom cells:** rows whose compensation leaves
  advance≠paint at the right edge can leave unpainted phantom cells;
  `FrameDiffWriter.repaintRightEdge` runs a scoped second pass.

### Input behaviour

- **Keys:** sends bare `ESC[A/B` for Up/Down — **all modifiers stripped**
  on the vertical arrows (Shift/Opt/Ctrl/Cmd); Left/Right keep their
  modifiers. Shift+Up/Down accelerators can never work here.
- **Mouse:** SGR (1006) reporting works: click press/release, wheel
  64/65. **Shift+wheel is intercepted** for the terminal's own scrollback
  — apps never see it (the Mouse demo notes this; use a trackpad's
  horizontal scroll instead). Trackpad horizontal scroll reports the
  standard horizontal wheel buttons 66/67. Right-click is reported to
  apps.
- **Mouse modifiers (byte-captured 2026-07-14, one run per modifier):**
  - **⌘-click: stripped to a plain click.** Eight deliberate ⌘-click
    press/release pairs ALL arrived as bare button code 0, symmetric —
    the app cannot tell a ⌘-click from a plain click, so **⌘-click
    multi-select toggling cannot work here** (the plain click replaces
    the selection). The pointer mirror of the Up/Down key modifier
    stripping above; not an app bug.
  - **⌥-click: forwarded as +8 (meta), symmetric** — the bit is present
    on both the press (`M`) and the release (`m`), and identically
    whether the profile's keyboard **"Use Option as Meta key"** setting
    is off or on (captured under both). TUIkit maps +8 to
    `MouseEvent.meta`, so **⌥-click** toggles rows in a multi-selection
    here. Note this is the *opposite* forwarding choice from iTerm2,
    which delivers ⌘ as +8 and swallows ⌥ (see its Input section).

---

## iTerm2

**Tested:** `TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION` 3.6.11, macOS 15.7, default profile,
2026-07-13.

### Environment

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `TERM` | `xterm-256color` |
| `TERM_PROGRAM` | `iTerm.app` |
| `TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION` | `3.6.11` |
| `COLORTERM` | `truecolor` |
| `TERM_SESSION_ID` / `ITERM_SESSION_ID` | `wNtNpN:UUID` (both, same value) |
| `ITERM_PROFILE` | profile name |
| `LC_TERMINAL` / `LC_TERMINAL_VERSION` | `iTerm2` / version (propagates over ssh) |
| `COLORFGBG` | e.g. `0;15` |
| `TERMINFO_DIRS` | app bundle terminfo + system |

### Output behaviour

⚠️ Much of iTerm2's width handling is **configuration-dependent**
(Settings → Profiles → Text: Unicode version, ambiguous-width). All
values below are the DEFAULT profile; a profile on Unicode 8 widths would
measure differently — re-run `advance_probe.py` before trusting a
non-default setup.

- **Colour:** truecolor (24-bit) — gradients render smoothly.
- **VS-16 pictographic emoji — SCREEN-MODE DEPENDENT:** on the primary
  screen paints 2 / advances 2; on the **alternate screen** (where TUIkit
  apps run) paints 2 / **advances 1** — the same under-advance as
  Terminal.app, with the same EAW exceptions (〰️ 〽️ advance 2).
  Compensated with CUF(1) by `withITerm2CursorCompensation()`. (The
  primary-screen alignment card renders correctly; the app misrendered
  until the model was rebuilt from alternate-screen measurements —
  user-reported, byte-capture confirmed identical output bytes, and the
  `context_probe` isolated the screen mode as the variable.)
- **Fitzpatrick skin tones — split by plane:**
  - SMP bases (👍🏽): render MERGED (one skin-toned glyph), advance 2 ✓.
  - BMP bases (✊🏻 ☝🏽): render **base + separate 2-cell colour swatch**,
    advancing 4 / 3 — same numbers as Terminal.app's Bug B but with the
    swatch visible. Because TUIkit's layout claims 2, unstripped clusters
    shift the rest of the row. The iTerm2 output path therefore strips
    the modifiers (generic-yellow fallback, `withSkinToneFallback()`),
    which also makes output independent of the Unicode-version setting.
- **Flag pairs:** advance 2 ✓. **Lone regional indicator: advance 2**
  (differs from Terminal.app's 1) — width claim 2 ✓, nothing needed.
- **Keycaps** (1️⃣ #️⃣ *️⃣, bare or with VS-16): paints 2, **advances 1**
  (both screen modes) → CUF(1) via `withITerm2CursorCompensation()`.
- **SF Symbols (Plane-16 PUA):** paints 2 (monochrome, SGR-tintable),
  **advances 1** → CUF(1). Same under-advance as Terminal.app.
- **ZWJ sequences:** advance 2 ✓ (unlike Terminal.app) — EXCEPT
  VS-16-leading ones (❤️‍🔥) which advance 1 on the alternate screen;
  unhandled (ZWJ is unhandled on both hosts).
- **Emoji chrome with VS-15** (⬛︎ ⬜︎ + U+FE0E): monochrome, tintable,
  2 cells, no shear — on the `supportsEmojiChrome` allowlist, so
  `CheckboxStyle.automatic` = `.emoji` here too.
- **Block Elements:** gap-free full-cell coverage — `██` contiguous, no
  seams; shades ░▒▓ draw as a dotted crosshatch texture (font flavour,
  cosmetically different from Terminal.app's stipple). Half-block images
  (▀) and background-fill images render seamlessly. Because the crosshatch
  covers less of the cell than a solid `█`, a bar that mixes the two — a
  `█` fill against a `░` empty run — reads with the filled part visibly
  TALLER than the empty part here. So `TrackStyle.block` (and `.blockFine`)
  paint the empty run as a solid *background* instead of a `░` glyph,
  giving a uniform-height two-tone bar on every terminal.

### Input behaviour

- **Mouse (byte-captured):** SGR click `0` press/`m` release; wheel
  64/65. macOS translates **Shift+wheel into horizontal wheel deltas**, so
  iTerm2 reports Shift+wheel as the standard horizontal buttons **66/67**
  (+4 Shift) — reaching apps, unlike Terminal.app. (TUIkit's decoder
  maps 66/67 to `.scrollLeft`/`.scrollRight`; a pre-2026-07 decoder
  collapsed both into `.scrollDown`, which made Shift+wheel always scroll
  right.)
- **Right-click:** by DEFAULT iTerm2 opens its own context menu and the
  app never sees the click; configurable in Settings → Pointer
  (user-reported). **⌘-click is reported to apps as an ⌥-click**
  (user-reported). There is no escape sequence or variable that exposes
  the pointer configuration, so TUIkit cannot detect the setting; the
  example's Mouse page shows a static note under iTerm2 instead.
- **Modifier-clicks (byte-captured 2026-07-14, one run per modifier):**
  - **⌘-click → +8 (meta), symmetric.** Six deliberate ⌘-clicks arrived
    as SGR button code **8** with the meta bit present on **both** the
    press (`M`) **and** the matching release (`m`) — every pair fully
    symmetric (`ESC[<8;x;yM` … `ESC[<8;x;ym`). The earlier
    **release-drops-meta hypothesis is refuted** for iTerm2 3.6.11:
    release-acting handlers (List/Table selection, tap gestures) see the
    decorated click intact. `MouseEventDispatcher.stampClickCount` still
    unions the press's modifier bits onto the matching release as
    defence-in-depth for unmeasured terminals; on iTerm2 it is a no-op.
    This is also the byte-level substance of the user-reported "⌘-click
    reads as ⌥-click": ⌘ is delivered as the protocol's meta (alt) bit,
    which apps decode as an option-click.
  - **⌥-click → nothing.** A dedicated ⌥-click run produced **no report
    at all** — the default pointer bindings consume ⌥-clicks (cursor
    placement / rectangular selection), so apps never see them.
  - Net: iTerm2 forwards **⌘** and swallows **⌥** — the *opposite* of
    Apple Terminal (which forwards ⌥ as +8 and strips ⌘; see its Input
    section). Both deliver the surviving key as the same +8 bit, so
    TUIkit's `ctrl || meta` multi-select toggle works on both — but any
    user-facing hint must name a different physical key per terminal:
    **⌘-click here, ⌥-click in Apple Terminal**.

  *Earlier general captures (2026-07-14, before the probe logged
  `TERM_PROGRAM`):* plain clicks are **symmetric** (press `M` and
  release `m` carry the same button code, all SGR — no X10 "any
  release" fallback seen); shift+horizontal wheel arrives as **70/71**
  (66/67 + shift), confirming the Shift-wheel decoding above; drags
  report `+32` motion codes with clean SGR releases.
- iTerm2 honours a large proprietary escape set (OSC 1337) — unused by
  TUIkit so far.
- **Cell aspect ratio (image distortion):** iTerm2's cell height:width
  ratio differs from Apple Terminal's (font + line-spacing dependent), so
  an `Image` sized for a fixed 2:1 assumption looked horizontally squished
  here (user-reported). **Measured** with `cell_aspect_probe.py`
  (2026-07-14, default fonts/profiles):

  | Terminal | ioctl `TIOCGWINSZ` px fields | CSI `14t`/`18t` | aspect (ioctl / CSI) |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | Apple_Terminal 455.1 | 215×54 ch, 1505×756 px → 7.00×14.00 px/cell | 1515×763 px → 7.05×14.13 | **2.000** / 2.005 |
  | iTerm.app 3.6.11 | 80×25 ch, 1120×850 px → 14.00×34.00 px/cell | 570×458 px → 7.12×18.32 | **2.429** / 2.571 |

  Both terminals DO populate the `ws_xpixel`/`ws_ypixel` fields (the
  historical-zero concern did not reproduce), so the render root's
  auto-detection is live on both. Apple Terminal's two reports agree
  (2.000 ≈ 2.005) and match the framework's 2.0 default exactly. iTerm2's
  two reports **disagree by ~6%** (ioctl 2.429 vs CSI 2.571): the CSI
  report is self-consistent in points, while the ioctl fields look like a
  differently-rounded (retina-scaled) cell metric — either confirms iTerm2
  is meaningfully taller than 2:1, and the ~6% residual between them is
  visually minor. **Defence:** `ASCIIConverter.targetSize` takes a
  `cellAspect` parameter (default `2.0` ≈ Apple Terminal), threaded from
  `environment.imageCellAspect`; the render root auto-detects via
  `Terminal.cellPixelAspect()` (ioctl-based → 2.43 on this iTerm2, within
  the 1.0…4.0 sanity band), and `.imageCellAspect(_:)` overrides
  explicitly. *Residual: if circles still look slightly tall on iTerm2,
  the CSI-derived 2.57 is the candidate correction — verify by eye with a
  known-square image before switching sources.*

## Ghostty

**Tested:** 1.3.1 (`TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION`), macOS 15.7, default config,
2026-07-14.

### Environment

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `TERM` | `xterm-ghostty` (ships its own terminfo; often overridden to `xterm-256color` for remote hosts, so **do not detect on `TERM`**) |
| `TERM_PROGRAM` | `ghostty` |
| `TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION` | `1.3.1` |
| `COLORTERM` | `truecolor` |
| `TERMINFO` | app bundle terminfo |
| `GHOSTTY_BIN_DIR` / `GHOSTTY_RESOURCES_DIR` / `GHOSTTY_SHELL_FEATURES` | set |
| `__CFBundleIdentifier` | `com.mitchellh.ghostty` |

### Output behaviour

**Ghostty is the most Unicode-correct terminal measured.** Every class that
Terminal.app and iTerm2 get wrong — VS-16 pictographs, ZWJ sequences,
Fitzpatrick skin tones, keycaps, flags, lone regional indicators — advances
by exactly the 2 cells `terminalWidth` claims, on BOTH screen buffers
(primary and alternate agree on every row of the battery). Skin-toned emoji
render as one merged glyph (👍🏽 = 2 cells), so the iTerm2/Warp swatch strip
is deliberately NOT applied here — it would discard a correct rendering.

- **Colour:** truecolor.
- **Two under-advancers** (the only compensation Ghostty needs —
  `withGhosttyCursorCompensation()`):
  - **VS-15 chrome glyphs** (⬛︎ ⬜︎ = emoji-presentation base + U+FE0E):
    paints 2, **advances 1**. Uncompensated this collides the following
    label with the glyph — observed on the Toggle demo as `■On` where
    `.unicode` correctly showed `■ On`. CUF(1) fixes it, which is what
    earns Ghostty its place on the `supportsEmojiChrome` allowlist.
  - **SF Symbols (Plane-16 PUA):** unlike Terminal.app/iTerm2 (which paint
    2 and advance 1), Ghostty renders these grid-strictly at **1 cell** and
    advances 1. The claim of 2 is therefore an over-claim here; CUF(1)
    keeps the row aligned at the cost of one blank cell after each symbol.
    *A tighter fix would be a host-dependent width claim, but the claim is
    deliberately host-independent (layout must be identical headless).*
- **`☝🏽` / `☝️🏽`** (BMP text-presentation base + skin tone) advance 1 and
  **4** respectively against a claim of 2 — the only over-advance measured
  on Ghostty. Unhandled, as ZWJ is on Terminal.app; these clusters do not
  appear in TUIkit's own chrome.
- **Cell aspect ratio:** fills `ws_xpixel`/`ws_ypixel` AND answers CSI
  14t/18t, which agree within ~1.4% (ioctl **2.154**, CSI 2.125 — default
  font). Slightly taller than the 2.0 default; auto-detection handles it.

### Input behaviour

- **Mouse (byte-captured 2026-07-14):** textbook SGR (1006). Plain clicks
  are symmetric (`ESC[<0;13;6M` press / `ESC[<0;13;6m` release); wheel is
  64 (up) / 65 (down); **horizontal wheel reports 66/67**, which is
  exactly what TUIkit's decoder maps to `.scrollLeft`/`.scrollRight`. No
  quirk found — nothing to work around.
- *Not yet captured:* modifier-clicks (⌘/⌥). Ghostty is expected to
  forward more than the Apple terminals do (it has no ⌘-click binding of
  its own by default), but that is a hypothesis until byte-captured —
  run `mouse_probe.py` and ⌘-click, then ⌥-click, in separate runs. The
  key-encoding side (arrows + modifiers, Fn keys, Escape timing) is also
  uncaptured.

## Warp

**Tested:** `v0.2026.07.08.17.54.stable_02`, macOS 15.7, default config,
2026-07-14.

### Environment

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `TERM` | `xterm-256color` (**not** a Warp-specific value — detect on `TERM_PROGRAM`) |
| `TERM_PROGRAM` | `WarpTerminal` |
| `TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION` | `v0.2026.07.08.17.54.stable_02` |
| `COLORTERM` | `truecolor` |
| `WARP_TERMINAL_SESSION_UUID` / `WARP_IS_LOCAL_SHELL_SESSION` / `WARP_HONOR_PS1` … | set |
| `__CFBundleIdentifier` | `dev.warp.Warp-Stable` |

### Output behaviour

Warp is the mirror image of Ghostty: it gets the *selector* classes right
and the *composed* classes wrong.

- **Colour:** truecolor.
- **VS-16 pictographs** (❤️ ✏️ 🖥️) advance 2 ✓ — no Bug-A compensation
  (unlike Terminal.app and iTerm2).
- **VS-15 chrome** (⬛︎ ⬜︎) advances 2 ✓ and paints clean squares → Warp is
  on the `supportsEmojiChrome` allowlist with no help at all.
- **Fitzpatrick skin tones paint base + a separate swatch at 4 cells**
  (3 for BMP bases) against a claim of 2 — the same shape as Terminal.app's
  Bug B and iTerm2's. **Observed** in the demo's "Unicode compatible"
  feature box: the skin-toned 👍🏽 sheared the box's right border two cells
  out of place. Handled by the shared `withSkinToneFallback()` strip.
- **Lone regional indicator** (🇦) advances 1 against a claim of 2 — same as
  Terminal.app; CUF via `withWarpCursorCompensation()`.
- **OVER-advancers, unhandled** (no escape can pull a cursor back to a
  column the glyph has already painted over):
  keycaps 1️⃣ #️⃣ *️⃣ advance **3**; 〰️ 〽️ advance **3**; ZWJ 👩‍🚀
  advances **5**, ❤️‍🔥 **5**, 👩🏽‍🚀 **7**. ZWJ is equally unhandled on
  Terminal.app (5/4/7), so this is the established limitation, not a new
  one — but keycaps and 〰️ are Warp-specific and DO shear rows.
- ⚠️ **Warp disagrees with itself across screen buffers** — more than any
  other terminal measured. Primary advances VS-16 by 1, alternate by 2;
  keycaps 1 vs 3; ZWJ 4/3/6 vs 5/5/7. The models use the **alternate**
  screen, where TUIkit apps run. Probe with `PROBE_ALT=1`.
- **Cell aspect ratio:** fills `ws_xpixel`/`ws_ypixel` AND answers CSI
  14t/18t, agreeing within ~2% (ioctl **1.956**, CSI 2.000) — essentially
  the 2.0 default, so images need no correction here.

### Input behaviour

Mouse SGR (1006) reporting works; **not yet byte-captured** (clicks, wheel,
modifiers, key encodings all remain to be measured — do not assume they
match Ghostty's). Warp defaults to `default_session_mode = "agent"` in
`~/.warp/settings.toml`, and its own UI overlays (tab switcher, command
palette) sit above the app — neither affects the app's byte stream.

**Driving Warp non-interactively** (it has no `-e`): write a launch
configuration to `~/.warp/launch_configurations/NAME.yaml` with a
`commands: - exec: …` entry and open `warp://launch/NAME`. Ghostty by
contrast takes `open -na Ghostty.app --args -e <cmd>`.

## tmux

**Status: NOT yet locally verified** — tmux is not installed on the
evaluation machine (no Homebrew either). The notes below are from tmux's
documented behaviour; treat them as expectations to verify, not
measurements.

- tmux (≥3.2) sets `TERM_PROGRAM=tmux` and `TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION`, and
  always sets `$TMUX` (socket path) and `$TMUX_PANE`. `TERM` inside is
  `screen-256color` or `tmux-256color`. This is why the Apple-Terminal
  tweaks do not apply when TUIkit runs under tmux inside Terminal.app:
  `TERM_PROGRAM` no longer says `Apple_Terminal` — and that is CORRECT
  behaviour, not a detection bug, because…
- …tmux is a **compositor**, not a passthrough: it parses TUIkit's output
  into its own cell grid using ITS OWN width tables, then re-renders that
  grid to the attached client. The outer terminal's advance quirks apply
  to *tmux's* output, not TUIkit's; what matters for TUIkit under tmux is
  agreement between TUIkit's width tables and *tmux's* (wcwidth-based,
  varies with tmux's Unicode tables). Host-specific CUF compensation
  would corrupt output under tmux and must stay off (it does — neither
  detector matches).
- Mouse: with `set -g mouse on`, tmux consumes mouse reports for its own
  panes and re-emits SGR sequences to the focused pane's application.
  Encoding fidelity (horizontal wheel, modifiers) needs verification.
- The outer terminal is not reliably identifiable from inside tmux
  (`LC_TERMINAL` propagates for iTerm2 ssh integration only; the tmux
  server keeps the environment of its FIRST client, which may not be the
  current one).

**Verification checklist when tmux becomes available:** run
`advance_probe.py` inside tmux under both Terminal.app and iTerm2 clients
(expect identical results in both — that's the compositor property);
byte-capture the mouse encoding with `mouse_probe.py`; check VS-16 /
skin-tone / PUA advances against TUIkit's width claims; record
`TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION`.

## Measured advance table (divergences and key rows)

DSR-measured on the ALTERNATE screen (the app's buffer). Terminal.app +
iTerm2 2026-07-13; Ghostty + Warp 2026-07-14 (Terminal.app re-measured the
same day — identical, so the harness is cross-validated). Full battery in
`Tools/TerminalProbes/` (`PROBE_ALT=1`). Claim = `Character.terminalWidth`.
Terminal.app and Ghostty measure identically in both screen modes; iTerm2
and (much more so) Warp do NOT — always probe with `PROBE_ALT=1`.

**Bold = diverges from the claim** (i.e. needs compensation, or shears).

### The blanket-range over-claim (a CLAIM bug, not a terminal bug)

**Not to be confused with `🖥️`** (U+1F5A5 **+ U+FE0F**) — the form the demo
app and virtually all real text uses. That one is correct on all four
terminals today: Apple/iTerm2 under-advance it and the CUF fixes it,
Ghostty/Warp advance it correctly. **The rows below are the BARE form**, no
variation selector, which is a different grapheme cluster.

`terminalWidth` ends with a blanket `0x1F000...0x1FBFF → 2` range rule. That
block is not uniformly wide: it also holds **text**-presentation pictographs
(`Emoji=Yes, Emoji_Presentation=No`) and non-emoji symbols. Measured
2026-07-14 (Apple 455.1 / Ghostty 1.3.1 / Warp 2026.07.08 — all three
identical):

| Class | Example | `isEmojiPresentation` | Claim | Advance (all terminals) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| BMP text-presentation | ✏ ❤ ☝ ☂ ✔ ☎ | false | **1** ✓ | 1 |
| SMP text-presentation | 🖥 🛡 🕹 🕷 🎞 🏙 | false | **2** ✗ | 1 |
| SMP emoji-presentation | 👍 🀄 | true | 2 ✓ | 2 |
| In-block non-emoji | 🁠 🂡 | false | **2** ✗ | 1 |

The first two rows are the same Unicode class and differ only by plane, so
the claim is internally inconsistent: the blanket rule fires for the SMP
ones and not their BMP twins. The emoji-presentation ones are already caught
by the earlier `isEmojiPresentation` check, so the blanket rule is not
load-bearing for them.

The defect does not depend on knowing the painted width, because the
**models contradict their own measurements**: for bare 🖥,
`terminalAppCursorAdvance` returns 2 (it inherits `terminalWidth` — the
cluster is a single scalar, so `isVS16UnderAdvancer` cannot fire) while the
probe measures 1. Model == claim ⇒ no CUF is emitted ⇒ any row containing
one shears left by a cell and its container over-reserves by one.

**Unfixed, deliberately.** The fix direction is NOT yet decided, because it
turns on the *painted* width, which is eyeball-only and has been checked on
Ghostty alone (paints 1 — so there, claim should be 1). If Apple Terminal
paints these 2 and advances 1 — the same shape as its VS-16 Bug A — then
Apple would want claim 2 + CUF while Ghostty wants claim 1, and a
host-independent claim cannot satisfy both. Resolve that first. Changing
`terminalWidth` also moves golden snapshots. **Reach:** unreachable from
TUIkit's own chrome and from the demo app (every 🖥️ there carries VS-16) —
it needs user content holding a bare text-presentation pictograph.

**SF Symbols PUA** is the other claim-vs-advance mismatch (no terminal
advances 2), but it is NOT the same bug: Apple/iTerm2 genuinely *paint* 2,
so the claim is right there and CUF is the correct fix. Only Ghostty paints
1, and its CUF buys alignment at the cost of a blank cell.

## Where the adaptations live

- `TerminalHost` — `TERM_PROGRAM` detection (`Apple_Terminal`,
  `iTerm.app`, `ghostty`, `WarpTerminal`) + the `supportsEmojiChrome`
  allowlist (all four; Ghostty only because its CUF fixes the VS-15
  under-advance).
- `Character.terminalAppCursorAdvance` / `.iTerm2CursorAdvance` /
  `.ghosttyCursorAdvance` / `.warpCursorAdvance` — the per-host advance
  models (TUIkitCore), each pinned to the table above by
  `GhosttyWarpCompatibilityTests` / `StringTerminalWidthTests`.
- `String+CursorCompensation.swift` — the per-host line rewriters.
  `withCursorForwardCompensation(advance:)` is the shared CUF walk for
  every host whose quirks are pure under-advances (iTerm2, Ghostty, Warp);
  Terminal.app keeps its own walk because it must also rewrite content.
  `String.withSkinToneFallback()` — the swatch strip, used by iTerm2 AND
  Warp (NOT Ghostty, which merges skin tones correctly).

### Per-host output pipeline (FrameDiffWriter)

| Host | Clip | Then |
|---|---|---|
| Apple Terminal | cursor-aware | `withTerminalAppCursorCompensation()` |
| iTerm2 | plain | `withSkinToneFallback()` → `withITerm2CursorCompensation()` |
| Ghostty | plain | `withGhosttyCursorCompensation()` |
| Warp | plain | `withSkinToneFallback()` → `withWarpCursorCompensation()` |
| anything else | plain | **untouched** (compensation would corrupt a correct terminal) |
- `FrameDiffWriter` — applies the rewriters on its build path; Apple-only
  right-edge repaint.
- `CheckboxStyle.automatic` + `SwitchIndicatorGlyphs` — chrome glyph
  selection per host.
